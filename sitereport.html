			<h1>Experience</h1>
			<p>After joining Naya Aayam Multidiscplinary Institue(NAMI), I had chosen Bsc. Computing as a major. In my first year  I have got 6 modules and we have to study 3 modules which are Computer System, Database, Web development. I showed more interest in web development than other two subjects. After first class I found that this web development is more interesting and took more interest in this. I am always attracted towards coding and programming after watching such code, it increases my interest. Whenever web development class held I took more interest and did each and every assignment. After a few weeks of class we got our first assignment of web development.That assignment is for developing a portfolio website. And before getting assignment I was excited and I was on a dream that it won't be much difficult. But after getting assignment I was totally shocked and I thought there was a lot of restriction on it and I also thought that how can I do and how to complete it without any objection. After that I started my project and how to make a good looking portfolio website. First of all I started home page then after I made portfolio and others respectively. In first I used to make different background few were in dark background and some of were in light but after that I finally decided to make dark background to all of it and it was really  beautiful. After that I used to make some animation to the menu bar and other part of website. In first I had face many problems and couldn't solve and then I take my time and watch and found out that some of the part weren't in right position and I used inspect element to find out the problem where I looked for margin padding and width of the element and their style and I debug the various problem and made a good website and I also made it responsive with different media queries. With media queries and meta tag all the page is in the right position.And then I have completed my assignment in a great way.</p>

And in both image all the text is in lightgolden color to look bright and eyecatching. In the first image I had given background color for both nav and footer but in second I remove both background color and make it transparent so the background look perfect. In first one I have made non scrolling page but in second one it is scrolling so to take full photo I have made it small in size. That's why it looks very tiny.</p></div>
